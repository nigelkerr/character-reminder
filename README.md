character-reminder
==================

A chrome plugin that will highlight characters that the user lists as
highlightable.  Original intent was to highlight Kanji that I am
supposed to know already in web pages, as inspiration.  I wish that I
had a firmer pedagogical basis than that.

Not very sophisticated.  Owes a lot of inspiration and snippets of code to the very-sophisticated Furigana Injector (http://code.google.com/p/furigana-injector/).

Commentary and steering and such all welcome.
