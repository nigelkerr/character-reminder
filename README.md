or the chrome plugin formerly known as character-reminder
=========================================================

A chrome plugin that will toggle highlight on characters that the user lists or
is supposed to know on Wani-Kani.  Original intent was to highlight
Kanji that I am supposed to know already in web pages, as inspiration.
I wish that I had a firmer pedagogical basis than that.

It looks like this when it is functioning: https://github.com/nigelkerr/character-reminder/blob/master/screenshot-0.7.jpg

Git clone this down or fetch the zip (https://github.com/nigelkerr/character-reminder/archive/master.zip) then install in Chrome
as an unpacked extension.

Not very sophisticated.  Barely documented. Owes a lot of inspiration
and snippets of code to the very-sophisticated Furigana Injector
(http://code.google.com/p/furigana-injector/), and to feedback on WaniKani.

The options dialog lets you enter your own list of kanji, or, if you
have a Wani-Kani API Key, to get your list fetched from there.  You
probably don't want to refresh more than once a day.

Commentary and steering and such all welcome.

Now with a snappier name, "futoji" for "bold letters".

It would be nice if:

* The highlight color/effects could be user selectable
* Words and vocabulary could be highlit as well as just straight-up Kanji
* There was a better reason to use this plugin than "inspiration"!
